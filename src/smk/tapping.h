// Tap-or-hold keys: LT(layer, kc) and MT(mods, kc). Tapped, the key sends `kc`; held longer than
// TAPPING_TERM it switches the layer on or holds the modifiers.
//
// With KEYMAP_TAP_DANCE_COUNT, TD(n) keys do the same with the five words of tap dance n (keymap_store_tap_dance_get): a tap sends
// "on tap", a hold longer than the term holds "on hold" (or "on tap" if that is empty), and when "on double tap" is set a second tap
// within the term sends it instead (a single tap then waits one term to be sure).
//
// While such a key is undecided, the key events that follow are kept in a small queue and replayed once
// it is decided, so a key typed during the wait lands on the right layer (QMK does the same). No
// "permissive hold" or "hold on other key press": the decision is the release (tap) or the timeout (hold).
